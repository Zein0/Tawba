### Important Notes

⚠️ **Node Version Warning**: 
The project currently uses Node v20.15.0, but some packages (Metro, React Native 0.81) require Node >= 20.19.4. While the project will work with the current Node version, consider upgrading Node.js for best compatibility:
```bash
nvm install 20.19.4
nvm use 20.19.4
```

### Breaking Changes to Be Aware Of

1. **React 19**: The project now uses React 19, which includes:
   - Improved error handling
   - New compiler optimizations
   - Updated hooks behavior

2. **Expo Router 6**: Major update with:
   - Improved routing performance
   - New navigation APIs
   - Better TypeScript support

3. **React Native 0.81**: Includes:
   - New Architecture improvements
   - Metro bundler updates
   - Improved performance

### Configuration Changes

1. **Added .npmrc file**: Configured to use `legacy-peer-deps=true` for all npm installs, including EAS builds
2. **Updated start script**: Now uses `--tunnel` flag by default for better network compatibility

### Next Steps

1. **Clear Cache** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```
   
   Or simply:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   (Now includes --tunnel flag automatically)

2. **Rebuild Native Code**:
   ```bash
   # For development
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   
   # Or for production builds
   npx eas build --platform all --profile production
   ```

3. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Test all screens and navigation
   - Verify prayer times functionality
   - Check notifications
   - Test location services
   - Verify SQLite database operations
   - Test both iOS and Android platforms

4. **Check for Type Errors**:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

5. **Update iOS/Android Projects** (if using bare workflow):
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```

### Legacy Peer Dependencies

The project was upgraded using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle React 19 peer dependency conflicts. This is normal for cutting-edge versions and shouldn't cause issues.

### Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Reanimated v4**: Check animated components - syntax may need updates
2. **Expo Router v6**: Navigation patterns may have changed
3. **React 19**: Some third-party libraries might not be fully compatible yet
